## FAQs

##### The downloaded file doesn't play on my computer, what's wrong?

Try using a different media player. The best free media player out there is [VLC Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html). Install and use that to ensure you can playback all desired media files.

##### I want to convert the media to another format, how do I do that?

The best free easy-to-use GUI tool is [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/).

##### Feature X isn't working correctly, why not?

This app is currently in pre-release and not everything will work correctly. Please standby for further updates.
